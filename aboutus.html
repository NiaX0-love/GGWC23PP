                <h4 id="story2">Cookie Inc. had very humble beginnings, starting out in the home kitchen of our founder Rania Aqila in December 2021. From there, the brand quickly expanded to a fully professional kitchen, creating a delicious spread of delectable hand-crafted cookies using only the highest quality and natural ingredients. In early 2022, Dough Lab opened its first shop in Senopati, Kebayoran Baru.

                Today, Cookie Inc. has grown to 20 locations across Jakarta, Tangerang, Depok, Bekasi and Surabaya. In addition to our premium, artisanal baked cookies, we offer variants of great coffee pairings on our beverage menu.

                A unique characteristic of Cookie Inc are its “cookie personalities”. Throughout her life, Rania has been surrounded by strong, unique women who have inspired her. The cookie personalities of Cookie Inc are an acknowledgement to those women in her life. The Cookie Moster, Rania's favourtie cookie as a child, is your classic loveable girl next door. Another favourite, the Smore's, a dark chocolate cookie topped with the sweet toasted marhmallow, represents someone who is compassionate and hopeful. Cookie Inc is guided by Rania’s unwavering commitment of using only the highest quality ingredients. Rania and her team take as much pride and care in creating the personality for each cookie as they do in creating the actual cookie itself.
